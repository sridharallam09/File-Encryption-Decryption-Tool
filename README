File Encryption/Decryption Tool
Overview
The File Encryption/Decryption Tool is a web-based application that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES-GCM encryption. This tool is designed to protect sensitive information by converting files into a coded format that can only be accessed with the correct password or key.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy file selection and password entry.
Secure Encryption: Utilizes AES-GCM encryption to ensure data confidentiality.
Decryption Capability: Allows users to decrypt files using the same password used for encryption.
Download Processed Files: Users can download the encrypted or decrypted files directly from the interface.
Cross-Platform: Works on any modern web browser without the need for installation.
Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Web Crypto API
How to Use
Open the Tool: Open the file-encryption-tool.html file in a web browser.
Select a File: Click on the "Select File" button to choose the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter Password: Input a password or key in the provided text box. This will be used for both encryption and decryption.
Encrypt or Decrypt:
To encrypt the file, click the "Encrypt" button. The tool will process the file and provide a download link for the encrypted file.
To decrypt a file, select the encrypted file and click the "Decrypt" button. The tool will process the file and provide a download link for the decrypted file.
Download the Result: Click the download link to save the processed file to your device.
Security Considerations
Ensure that you use a strong password for encryption to enhance security.
Do not share your password with others, as it is required for decryption.
The tool does not store any files or passwords; all operations are performed locally in your browser.
Limitations
The tool is designed for small to medium-sized files. Very large files may take longer to process or may not be supported due to browser limitations.
The encrypted files must be decrypted using the same password used for encryption.
